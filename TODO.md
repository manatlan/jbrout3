TODO file to reach the 1.0.0 (usable version, could replace original jbrout/py2)

- A lot of polish (ui/styles)
- bottleneck/slowdown when listview contains more than 10000 photos
- drag'n'drop features :
    drag'n'drop from OS to jbrout, to add folders to db (not possible without cefpython)
    drag'n'drop folders to folders (to move/organize albums)
    drag'n'drop tags on photos
    drag'n'drop from jbrout to OS
- better viewer : add more infos + keyboard shortcuts
- basket feature !
- Search-Tab
- Time-Tab
- Filters view (?)
- implement all popupmenu's entries !
- comment album !
- navigate with keyboard in listview
- tag with keyboard
- thumbnail format + background info (no exif, etc ...)
